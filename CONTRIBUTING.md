Contributions are welcomed assuming my repositories are the correct place
for it (the target is my repository or a PR I have open to another repository).

In case [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) isn't
[natively supported by your editor of choice](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed),
please consider [installing a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download).  
E.g. VS Cod{e,ium} users can `CTRL-P` and execute `ext install EditorConfig.EditorConfig`.

Issues being assigned to me doesn't matter, I use that just as a tool for
rediscovering them easily, http://github.com/issues?q=is:open%20assignee:Mikaela

I also accept PRs to repositories that are mirrors (if that is easier for you
than opening at the original location) as patches are easy enough to export
from GitHub or `git remote`s to use, the merge might just take a bit longer
(including the time the mirror takes to update).
